What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording information about a program's execution. It helps developers track the program's behavior and diagnose issues by providing a record of events that occur during runtime. Logs can contain messages about the application's operations, warnings, errors, and debugging information.

Why Logging is Important
Debugging and Error Tracking: Logs provide detailed information about errors and exceptions, which helps in identifying and fixing issues. Performance Monitoring: Logs can be used to monitor the application's performance, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Security: Logs can help detect and investigate security breaches by recording unusual or unauthorized activities. Audit and Compliance: Logs provide a historical record of events, which is essential for audit trails and ensuring compliance with regulations. User Behavior Analysis: Logs can provide insights into user actions and interactions with the application. 3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels allow developers to categorize log messages by their importance. Common logging levels include:

TRACE: Very detailed logs, typically used for diagnosing problems. 
DEBUG: Detailed information on the flow through the system. Used for debugging. 
INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application. 
WARN: Potentially harmful situations of interest. 
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running. 
FATAL: Very severe error events that will lead to the application aborting.
